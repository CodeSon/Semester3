# Tutorial

1. What is quantum computing?
  - Fundamental difference in basic unit of information
  - How is it different?
  - Classical: relation between Turing and Von Neumann?
  - Can we replace abstract model? To replicate quantum effects not observed in macro objects.
  - Lack of a strong abstraction at early stage of quantum computing.

  State of system. 1 qubit, vector in 2d vector space. On interaction while attempting to read, in quantum we're limited to reading probability and not the exact values.

  Description of the state of the qubit: given in the image
