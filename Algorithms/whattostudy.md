### Dynamic Programming
Mathematical optimization method (c: [Bellman]() [Equation]()).

We're more interested in the Computer Programming aspect of it.

#### Problems To Cover
 - [LCS]()
 - [Polygon Triangulation]()
 - [Optimal Rod Cutting]()
 - Longest path in a weighted tree
 - 3-SAT SP Vertex covers
 - 3-SAT SP Subset sum
 - Chain Matrix multiplication

### Linear Programming

#### Problems to Cover
 - Duality
 - Geometric Method

### Randomized Algorithms

### Number-theoretic Algorithms

#### Problems to Cover
 - Primality Testing
  - Rabin Miller Randomized Primality test
 - GCD Problem
  - Naive
  - Euclid's Division Algorithm
    - Complexity Calculation: Approximation
    - Complexity O(log n)
  - [Stein's Algorithm]
    - Bitwise
    - O(N*N), N = Number of bits in larger number



### Polynomial Time Reduction

#### Problems to Cover
 - Vertex Cover
 - Subset Sum
 - Residue Number System

#### Side note: Residue Number System (RNS)
Speeds up arithmetic operations like multiplication, but not
addition.
