Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted Beane out of high school. Though scouts considered Beane hugely promising, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. Brand admits that, based on his method of assessing player value, he would not have drafted him until the ninth round. Impressed, Beane hires Brand as his assistant manager."]
